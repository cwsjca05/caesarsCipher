A project from freeCodeCamp for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects Developer Certification

The project required a rot13 algorithm, which is what was provided.  As the comments in the code indicate, however, it can be generalized to any rotation amount by requiring the rot as an argument to the function and updating rot references as necessary in the code body.  The actual coding work was completed on the freeCodeCamp website as part of the project.  This is just the completed code.

All work is original.
